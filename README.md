# COMB
Compilation of many breaches

Since I was not able to find COMB on github, I am creating this repository, so everyone can download the contents of this data breach.
It contains around 3.2 billion records.
More information about the breach can be found here: https://cybernews.com/news/largest-compilation-of-emails-and-passwords-leaked-free/
